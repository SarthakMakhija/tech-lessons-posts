description: "Persistent memory is non-volatile storage that fits in a standard DIMM slot. Persistent memory provides higher throughput than SSD and NVMe but is slower than DRAM. With persistent memory, memory contents remain even when system power goes down in the event of an unexpected power loss, user-initiated shutdown, or system crash."
